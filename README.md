**How shall we run our portfolio of projects in the context of Coronavirus?**

Some provisional ideas follow below, based upon the papers and articles attached. 
The following are all papers /articles from other sources, as cited within each document. 

PORTFOLIO
1. Portfolio needs to track in-house R0 (Reproduction rate) at the same level as revenue, cost and value
2. Each business decisions can then start to understand each project investment relative to this key new business constraint.

PROGRAMMES
1. There is likely to be a Business Recovery Programme, 
2. There is also likely to be a longer term Corona programme. 

PROJECTS
0. Review which projects are still continuing under-lockdown conditions and support
1. Most projects are already halted.
2. First priority is to identify which projects must restart. Answer = not many. 
3. Next priority is to identify the resource-hit from starting up Corona-related programmes.
4. Tidily mothball as many projects as possible, so they can be neatly restarted in due course. 
5. Supply chain emergency review, along with safety and distancing arrangements for the ongoing projects
6. Larger projects can start to look for 'small-world' team and customer arrangements, to minimise R0 reproduction rate (see Oxford paper)
